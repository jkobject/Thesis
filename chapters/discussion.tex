\section{AIVC}

recapitulating the main idea behind it
recapitulating the main results of the thesis
many promising things 
still a long way to go
Many issues. how to solve them?

\section{collecting data in the wild}

basecamp research is doing it. need the same for single cell

need smarter ways to collect and sequence cells

digital microfluidics

need more data and higher qualityn that means much cheaper and more efficient sequencing.

FRPs is the solution in scRNAseq

\section{multi modality}

with lower cost, might mean looking more at the proteins, tissue level organisation, imaging of the.

Also might need some rarer but needed chromatin state, mutation, and 3D genomic structure 

\section{perturbations}

Need the model to learn causality.

large scale perturbation datasets have begun to allow us this.

space is unfathomable.

large amount of data and needs by using active learning

perturbation also will need to be better quality using better models like organoids
